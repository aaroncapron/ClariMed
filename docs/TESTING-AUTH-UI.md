## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Invalid API key" Error
**Problem:** Environment variables not configured  
**Solution:**
1. Check `.env.local` exists
2. Verify it has `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### Email Not Arriving
**Problem:** Supabase email rate limits or spam  
**Solution:**
1. Check spam folder
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Try different email address
4. Check Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Logs

### TypeScript Errors
**Problem:** Database types not synced  
**Solution:**
1. Already fixed with `as any` type assertion
2. Errors should clear after connecting to Supabase
3. Run `npm run build` to check for any issues

### "User already registered" Error
**Problem:** Email already used  
**Solution:**
1. Use different email, OR
2. Go to Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Users
3. Delete the test user
4. Try again

### Can't See Form After Login
**Problem:** Auth state not updating  
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Clear browser cache if needed
