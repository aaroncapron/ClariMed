## 🔐 Security Checks

**Before every commit:**
- [ ] No `.env.local` in `git status`

- [ ] No real credentials anywhere

**If you see these in git status, DON'T COMMIT:**
- `.env.local`
- `.env`
- `*.backup` with real data

## 📧 Email Config

| Environment | Email Service | Action Required |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Development** | Supabase native | ✅ None - works now |
| **Production** | Custom SMTP | ⚠️ Must configure |

**Production SMTP:** Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → SMTP Settings

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option A: Set Up Supabase (Recommended First)
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Create free project
3. Follow: `docs/SUPABASE-SETUP.md`
4. Takes ~10 minutes
5. Return when done ✅

### Option B: Build UI First
Say: **"Let's build the signup/login UI"**
- We'll create forms and pages
- Use mock data for now
- Connect to Supabase later

## ⚠️ Production Checklist

**MUST DO before launching:**
- [ ] Configure custom SMTP
- [ ] Create Privacy Policy
- [ ] Create Terms of Service
- [ ] Add medical disclaimers
- [ ] Test all email flows
- [ ] Verify HTTPS enabled

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Can't find .env.local"**
→ It doesn't exist yet. Create it after Supabase setup.

**"TypeScript errors in auth.ts"**
→ Normal until Supabase is configured. Will resolve after setup.

**"Invalid API key"**
→ Check `.env.local` has correct URL and key. Restart dev server.
