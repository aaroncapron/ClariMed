# 🔒 Security & Privacy Checklist for ClariMed

**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025  
**Purpose:** Ensure all sensitive data is protected and best practices are followed

---

## ✅ Files & Configuration Security

### Environment Variables
- ✅ `.env.local.example` created (safe to commit - no real credentials)
- ✅ `.gitignore` includes `.env*.local` pattern
- ⚠️ **VERIFY:** No `.env.local` file exists in repository
- ⚠️ **VERIFY:** No real Supabase credentials in any committed files

### Gitignore Protection
Current `.gitignore` protects:
- ✅ `.env*.local` - All local environment files
- ✅ `node_modules/` - Dependencies
- ✅ `.next/` - Build outputs
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT-NOTES.md` - Private deployment info
- ✅ `_archive/` - Old codebase

**Recommendation:** Add these additional entries:
```
# Supabase local development
.supabase/

# Editor configs (if you don't want to share)
.vscode/settings.json
.idea/

# OS files
Thumbs.db
.DS_Store

# Backup files
*.backup
*.bak
*.tmp
```

## 🔑 Supabase Security

### API Keys
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Safe for client-side (public)
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Safe for client-side (RLS protects data)
- ⚠️ **NEVER COMMIT:** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Admin access, server-only

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Enabled on all tables
- ✅ Users can only access their own data
- ✅ Policies prevent unauthorized reads/writes
- ✅ Cascade deletes remove user data when account deleted

### Authentication
- ✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- ✅ HTTP-only cookies for sessions
- ✅ HTTPS enforced (via Vercel)
- ✅ Email verification required
- ⏳ Password reset flow (to be implemented)

---

## 📧 Email Configuration

### Development (Current)
- ✅ Using Supabase native email sender
- ✅ Sends from `noreply@mail.app.supabase.io`
- ✅ Good for testing

### Production (REQUIRED BEFORE LAUNCH)
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Must configure custom SMTP
- ⚠️ Options: SendGrid, Amazon SES, Resend, Mailgun
- ⚠️ Configure in: Supabase → Authentication → SMTP Settings
- ⚠️ Test all email flows before launch

**Why?**
- Native sender has rate limits
- May be flagged as spam
- Can't customize sender domain
- Not reliable for production traffic

---

## 🛡️ Code Security Best Practices

### Client vs Server Code
- ✅ Auth logic uses proper client/server separation
- ✅ `lib/supabase/client.ts` - Browser only
- ✅ `lib/supabase/server.ts` - Server only
- ✅ No server secrets in client code

### Data Validation
- ✅ Password strength validation (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special)
- ✅ Email format validation
- ⏳ Input sanitization (to be added in forms)
- ⏳ SQL injection protection (Supabase handles this)

### Error Handling
- ⏳ Never expose internal errors to users
- ⏳ Log errors securely (server-side only)
- ⏳ Generic error messages for auth failures ("Invalid credentials" not "User not found")

---

## 📊 Database Security

### Encryption
- ✅ Data encrypted at rest (Supabase default)
- ✅ Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- ⏳ Consider field-level encryption for extra sensitive data (future)

### Backups
- ⏳ Automatic backups (Supabase Pro plan)
- ⏳ Regular backup testing
- ⏳ Point-in-time recovery capability

### Access Control
- ✅ Row Level Security enforced
- ✅ Database roles properly configured
- ✅ No public schemas exposed
- ✅ Audit logs available in Supabase dashboard

---

## 🌐 Application Security

### HTTPS/TLS
- ✅ Enforced by Vercel in production
- ✅ No mixed content allowed
- ✅ Secure cookie flags set

### CORS & CSP
- ⏳ Configure Content Security Policy headers
- ⏳ Set proper CORS policies
- ⏳ Restrict iframe embedding

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ Supabase auth endpoints rate-limited
- ⏳ Add rate limiting for sensitive operations
- ⏳ Monitor for abuse patterns

---

## 🔍 Before Committing Code

### Pre-Commit Checklist
Every time you commit, verify:
- [ ] No `.env.local` file in staging area
- [ ] No API keys or credentials in code
- [ ] No console.log with sensitive data
- [ ] No hardcoded passwords or secrets
- [ ] No real user data in test files
- [ ] No database connection strings

### Git Commands to Check
```bash
# See what will be committed
git status

# See actual file contents to be committed
git diff --staged

# Check for accidentally added env files
git ls-files | grep -i "\.env"
```

---

## 🚨 If Credentials Are Exposed

### Immediate Actions
1. **Rotate compromised credentials immediately**
   - Go to Supabase → Settings → API
   - Generate new keys
   - Update `.env.local` locally
   - Update production environment variables

2. **Remove from git history** (if committed)
   ```bash
   # Remove file from history
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env.local" \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   
   # Force push (use with caution!)
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

3. **Check for unauthorized access**
   - Review Supabase logs
   - Check for unexpected API calls
   - Monitor database for suspicious activity

4. **Notify users if data breach occurred**
   - Follow breach notification requirements
   - Document the incident
   - Implement fixes to prevent recurrence

## 📝 Privacy Compliance

### User Data Rights
- ⏳ **Data Export** - Users can export their data (to be implemented)
- ⏳ **Data Deletion** - Users can delete their account
- ⏳ **Data Portability** - Export in standard format (JSON)
- ⏳ **Access Controls** - Users control who sees their data

### Privacy Policy Requirements
- ⏳ What data is collected
- ⏳ How data is used
- ⏳ Who data is shared with (3rd party APIs)
- ⏳ User rights (access, deletion, correction)
- ⏳ Contact information for privacy concerns

### Medical Data Considerations
- ✅ Not claiming to be a medical device
- ✅ Not providing medical advice
- ✅ Clear disclaimers throughout app
- ⏳ HIPAA awareness (not compliant yet)
- ⏳ Consider Business Associate Agreement for HIPAA

---

## 🔄 Regular Security Audits

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] Review Supabase audit logs
- [ ] Check for unusual access patterns
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are working
- [ ] Update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Review error logs for potential issues

### Quarterly Checks
- [ ] Full security audit of codebase
- [ ] Penetration testing (if budget allows)
- [ ] Review and update privacy policy
- [ ] Check third-party service security
- [ ] Update security documentation
