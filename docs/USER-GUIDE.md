## ✅ Understanding the Badges

When you add a medication, you might see colorful badges:

### **Green "✓ Verified" Badge**
- This means we found your medication in the official NIH drug database
- It's been double-checked for accuracy
- You can trust the spelling and dosage are correct

### **Purple "Maintenance" Badge**
- This means you probably take this medication every day for a long-term condition
- Examples: blood pressure pills, cholesterol medication, diabetes medication
- The app guesses this, but you can change it if it's wrong

## 📋 What is a "Maintenance Medication"?

**Simple Explanation:**
A maintenance medication is something you take regularly (usually every day) to manage a long-term health condition.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Blood pressure pills (like lisinopril)
- ✅ Cholesterol medication (like atorvastatin)
- ✅ Diabetes medication (like metformin)
- ✅ Thyroid medication (like levothyroxine)

**NOT Maintenance:**
- ❌ Antibiotics (you only take them for a week or two)
- ❌ Pain relievers you take "as needed" (like ibuprofen)
- ❌ Cough medicine

**Why does this matter?**
In the future, ClariMed will have a "Clarity Mode" that shows only your maintenance meds first, making it easier to see your daily medications at a glance!

## 🔍 Searching Your Medications

Got a lot of medications? Use the **search bar** at the top!

Type in:
- The medication name ("lisinopril")
- The dosage ("10 mg")

The list will instantly show only matching medications.

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### **Tip 1: Use the Autocomplete**
When adding a medication, you only need to type a few letters:
- Type "lisi" → see "lisinopril" options
- Type "atorv" → see "atorvastatin" options

This is faster and prevents spelling mistakes!

### **Tip 2: Let the App Fill in Dosages**
When you pick a medication from the autocomplete list, the dosage often fills in automatically. Just double-check it's correct!

### **Tip 3: Be Specific with Frequency**
Instead of "daily," write:
- "Once daily in the morning"
- "Twice daily with meals"
- "Before bed"

This helps you remember exactly when to take it!

### **Tip 4: Use Notes for Important Reminders**
Add things like:
- "Take with food"
- "Don't take with grapefruit juice"
- "Prescribed by Dr. Smith"

## 🆘 Common Questions

### **Q: Why do I see multiple versions of the same medication?**
A: Some medications come in different forms (tablets, capsules, liquids) or different strengths. Pick the one that matches your prescription bottle!

### **Q: What does "🔵 Generic" and "🟢 Brand" mean?**
A: 
- **Generic** (🔵): The basic version of the medication (usually cheaper)
- **Brand** (🟢): The name-brand version (like Prinivil instead of lisinopril)

They're the same medication, just different names and prices!

### **Q: Can I use this instead of talking to my doctor?**
A: **NO!** ClariMed is just a tracker. Always talk to your doctor or pharmacist about:
- Starting or stopping medications
- Side effects
- Drug interactions
- Dosage changes

### **Q: What if I can't find my medication?**
A: Try:
1. Check your prescription bottle for the exact spelling
2. Try searching just the first few letters
3. If it's a very new or rare medication, it might not be in the database yet

### **Q: Will this work on my phone?**
A: Yes! ClariMed works on:
- Computers (Windows, Mac)
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)
- Smartphones (iPhone, Android)

Just use your web browser!
