## 🚨 Critical Production Requirements

### Before Launch Checklist
1. ⚠️ **MUST configure custom SMTP**
   - Native Supabase email sender is for development only
   - Options: SendGrid, Amazon SES, Resend, Mailgun
   - Configure in Supabase dashboard

2. ⚠️ **MUST create Privacy Policy**
   - What data is collected
   - How data is used
   - User rights (access, deletion)

3. ⚠️ **MUST create Terms of Service**
   - User responsibilities
   - Service limitations
   - Medical disclaimers

4. ⚠️ **MUST add medical disclaimers**
   - Not a medical device
   - Not providing medical advice
   - Consult healthcare provider

5. ⚠️ **MUST configure HTTPS**
   - Vercel handles this automatically
   - Verify in production

## 📊 Security Posture

### Strengths
- ✅ Strong password requirements
- ✅ Row Level Security enforced
- ✅ Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- ✅ Proper separation of client/server code
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Areas for Improvement (Future)
- ⏳ Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- ⏳ Content Security Policy headers
- ⏳ Input sanitization in forms
- ⏳ Security monitoring and alerts
- ⏳ Penetration testing

## 🎯 Next Development Session

### Ready to Build: Signup/Login UI

**Prerequisites:**
1. Supabase project created
2. Database migration run
3. `.env.local` configured

**Tasks:**
1. Create signup form with validation
2. Create login form
3. Build signup page
4. Build login page
5. Add password strength indicator
6. Create AuthGuard component
7. Add navigation (Login/Signup buttons)
8. Test complete auth flow

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

## 📝 Notes

### Expected TypeScript Errors
The following error is NORMAL until Supabase is connected:
```
No overload matches this call... 'user_profiles'
```
This will resolve once:
1. Supabase project is created
2. Environment variables are configured
3. Dev server is restarted

### Files Safe to Commit
- ✅ All files in `lib/supabase/` (no credentials)
- ✅ All files in `docs/` (documentation)
- ✅ All files in `contexts/` (React components)
- ✅ `.env.local.example` (template only)
- ✅ `.gitignore` (protection rules)

### Files That Should NEVER Be Committed
- ❌ `.env.local` (real credentials)
- ❌ `.env` (real credentials)
- ❌ Any file with real Supabase URLs/keys
- ❌ Database dumps with user data

---

## ✅ Audit Conclusion

**The codebase is secure and ready for UI development.**

All sensitive data is properly protected, documentation is comprehensive, and production requirements are clearly documented. Proceed with building the authentication UI.

---

## 🚀 Green Light to Proceed

You can now safely move forward with building the signup/login interface. All security foundations are in place!

**When ready, say:** "Let's build the signup/login UI"
