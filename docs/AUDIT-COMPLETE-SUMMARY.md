## 📧 Email Configuration Summary

### For Development (Current)
```
✅ Using Supabase native email sender
✅ Sends from: noreply@mail.app.supabase.io
✅ Works out of the box
✅ Perfect for testing
✅ No configuration needed
```

### For Production (Before Launch)
```
⚠️ MUST configure custom SMTP
⚠️ Configure in Supabase dashboard
⚠️ Recommended: SendGrid, Amazon SES, Resend

Why?
- Native sender has rate limits
- May be marked as spam
- Can't customize sender domain
- Not reliable for production traffic
```

**Configuration Path:**
`Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings → SMTP Settings`

## 🎯 You're Ready to Proceed!

### All Prerequisites Met ✅
1. ✅ Documentation comprehensive and up-to-date
2. ✅ Security audit passed
3. ✅ `.gitignore` protecting all sensitive files
4. ✅ No credentials in repository
5. ✅ Production requirements documented
6. ✅ Email configuration requirements clear

### Next Steps

**Option 1: Set up Supabase Now**
If you're ready to create your Supabase project:
1. Follow `docs/SUPABASE-SETUP.md`
2. Create Supabase project (5-10 minutes)
3. Run database migration
4. Configure `.env.local`
5. Return and say: "Supabase is ready, let's build the UI"

**Option 2: Start UI Development**
We can build the signup/login UI with mock data first:
1. Build forms and validation
2. Create page layouts
3. Test with mock authentication
4. Connect to Supabase later

Just say: "Let's start building the signup/login UI"
